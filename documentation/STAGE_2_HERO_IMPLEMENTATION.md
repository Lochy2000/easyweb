# Stage 2: Enhanced Hero Section with Parallax Opening Scene

## What We've Implemented

### 1. **Parallax Opening Scene (2-3 seconds)**
- **Organic Glass Shapes**: Floating glassmorphic elements with organic border-radius
- **Particle Animation**: 12 floating particles with random movement patterns
- **Opening Branding**: Large "EASYWEBS" logo with gradient animation
- **Smooth Transitions**: Fade-out after 3 seconds to reveal main content

### 2. **Splash Cursor Effect**
- **Interactive Particles**: Mouse movement creates colorful particle trails
- **Hero Section Only**: Automatically disables when user scrolls past hero
- **Performance Optimized**: Canvas-based with efficient particle system
- **Cyan Color Theme**: Matches the new color palette

### 3. **Lamp Effect Integration**
- **Dynamic Lighting**: Animated conic gradients create spotlight effect
- **Cyan Accent**: Uses the new accent-cyan color for consistency
- **Responsive Design**: Scales properly on all screen sizes
- **Smooth Animation**: Motion-driven width and opacity changes

### 4. **Gooey Text Morphing**
- **Dynamic Text**: Cycles through "Innovate. Create. Build. Elevate."
- **SVG Filters**: Uses feColorMatrix for the morphing effect
- **Responsive Typography**: Scales from 4xl to 8xl across breakpoints
- **Pink Gradient**: Uses the new text-gradient-pink class

### 5. **Enhanced Content Structure**
- **New Messaging**: 
  - Main: "Innovate. Create. Build. Elevate."
  - Subtitle: "We craft bespoke digital experiences that drive growth and define the future of your brand."
- **Improved CTAs**: Two-button layout with enhanced hover effects
- **Scroll Indicator**: Animated scroll prompt at bottom

### 6. **Mobile Responsiveness**
- **Breakpoint Optimization**: sm, md, lg, xl responsive classes
- **Touch-Friendly**: Larger touch targets on mobile
- **Performance Considerations**: Reduced particle count on smaller screens
- **Flexible Layout**: Stack buttons vertically on mobile

### 7. **Performance Optimizations**
- **Conditional Rendering**: Splash cursor only renders in hero section
- **Efficient Animations**: Use of transform and opacity for hardware acceleration
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of event listeners and timers
- **Scroll-Based Controls**: Smart showing/hiding of effects
